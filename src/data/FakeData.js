    content: `Edwards and Rosée selected premises in St Michael's Alley, just off Cornhill and near the Royal Exchange. The lanes and alleys around the Exchange—a favoured place for merchants to meet daily—were busy with traders, lawyers, tavern keepers and the general public. The first incarnation of their coffee-house was a shed resembling a market stall on the edge of the churchyard of St Michael's Church.[18] A sign hung over Rosée's stall, described either as "an image of himself dressed in some Levantine clothing",[19] or a sign portraying his head.[20]

    To promote his enterprise, in 1652 Rosée published a handbill advertising The Vertue of the Coffee Drink in which he extolled the benefits of coffee,[1] claiming "It is excellent to prevent and cure the dropsy, gout and scurvy",[21] as well as scrofula, miscarriages and "a most excellent remedy against the spleen, hypocondriack winds and the like".[21] This was the earliest-known advertisement for coffee, according to the historian Aytoun Ellis.[22] The launch of the new product onto the London market was aided by the politics of the day, with puritans attacking the sale of wine and beer as being connected to the profligate and licentious activities of the Royalists. Taverners and wine merchants bemoaned the falling sales of their products in 1651 and 1652, and Rosée's positioning of coffee as a healthy and sober drink helped the product become commercially successful. One contemporary estimated that Rosée's turnover was 30 or 40 shillings a day – approximately £450 to 600 a year.[23][c]
    
    Markman Ellis considers the estimate is "probably overstated", although Rosée's business was successful enough to generate jealousy from local tavern owners; they petitioned the Lord Mayor of London on the basis that Rosée was not a freeman of the City of London, and therefore should not be able to trade as he did.[25] To overcome the barrier to Rosée's continuing trading, Edwards turned to his father-in-law, Alderman Thomas Hodges, who proposed one of his former apprentices, Christopher "Kitt" Bowman, a freeman of the City of London, to join Rosée as a partner, which took place in 1654.[1][26]

    In 1656 Rosée and Bowman moved from their shed into premises, also in St Michael's Alley, which measured 27.5 by 19 feet (8.4 by 5.8 m); the property was in poor condition, needing repairs and the men paid an annual rent of £4.[1][d] The two men operated in partnership until at least 1658 (when they were both listed in the churchwardens' accounts), but Rosée seems to have no part in the joint venture after that.[27] The two men also ran competing coffee-houses on opposite sides of the street,[1] which was remembered in doggerel verse, published under the name Adrianus del Tasso:[28]
    
    Pull courage, Pasqua, fear no Harms,
    From the besieging Foe;
    Make good your ground, stand to your Arms,
    Hold out this summer, and then tho'
    He'll storm, he'll not prevail—your Face
    Shall give the Coffee Pot the chace.[29]
    
    There are no records relating to Rosée after 1658.[27] The apothecary and writer John Houghton, writing in 1699, said that Rosée disappeared from London "for some misdemeanour",[30] although no record or evidence for the misdemeanour has been found.[31] There were claims that he left England and sold coffee in Germany or Holland—the latter in 1664—but there is no evidence to support either claim.[31][32]`,

    content: `Background and work in Smyrna
    Copy of the original advertisement The Vertue of the Coffee Drink
    The Vertue of the Coffee Drink, published by Rosée in 1652
    Pasqua Rosée was born in the early seventeenth century into the ethnic Greek community of the Republic of Ragusa (now southernmost Croatia),[1] and is variously described as Greek,[2][3] Armenian,[4][5] Turkish[6] and "of Greek or Turkish origin".[7] Little is known about his early life, but it is thought he spoke at least three languages: Greek, Turkish and English.[8]
    
    By 1651 Rosée was living in Smyrna (modern İzmir, Turkey), in the Ottoman Empire, where he became the servant of Daniel Edwards, an English merchant of the Levant Company.[1][9] The Levant Company was an English chartered company formed in 1592 with the purpose of regulating English trade with the Ottoman Empire and the Levant. The charter effectively provided a monopoly for fifty-three English merchants named in the text.[10] English traders preferred to employ Levantine servants as they were cheaper than those from England and had better knowledge of the local languages and customs.[9] Rosée's language skills made him an important aid for Edwards in business, and he acted as "a clerk of accounts, a translator and a social diplomat, using his knowledge of Turkish customs to smooth the path of commerce", according to the historian Markman Ellis;[11] he also acted in a personal capacity as Edwards's valet and coachman. Although Edwards's servants prepared and served his food, as his valet, Rosée prepared and served his coffee.[12]
    
    Edwards left Smyrna in late 1651 to return to England,[1] accompanied by Rosée; this was either because Edwards had thwarted activities of a royalist cadre in the Levant Company in 1647 and 1650, or because of an outbreak of plague in the region, which reached Smyrna in September 1651.[13][a] According to Markman Ellis, "Edwards brought some characteristics of Levantine merchants: hard work, Puritan politics and coffee drinking".[13] According to one of Edwards's friends, it was known he "drank two or three dishes [of coffee] at a time, twice or thrice a day".[15] Friends would visit Edwards frequently to share his coffee and socialise; so many visited to taste this novel drink that it impacted his family life, and in 1652 he decided to set up a coffee-house. As the rules of the Levant company meant he was unable to open it himself, he set up Rosée in business.`,

    content: `Pasqua Rosée (fl. 1651–1658) was a 17th-century servant who opened the first coffee-house in London and possibly Britain. He was born into the ethnic Greek community of the Republic of Ragusa (now southernmost Croatia). In 1651 he became the servant of Daniel Edwards, an English merchant of the Levant Company who was living in Smyrna (modern İzmir, Turkey) in the Ottoman Empire; Rosée's duties included preparing and serving Edwards's daily coffee.

    In late 1651 Edwards returned to London, taking Rosée with him. The number and frequency of friends visiting Edwards to drink coffee with him disrupted his social life, and so he set up Rosée as the proprietor of a coffee-house near the Royal Exchange. As he was not a freeman of the City of London he was not able to trade; accordingly Edwards made his father-in-law's former apprentice, Christopher "Kitt" Bowman—a freeman of the City—join Rosée as a partner. The last known reference to Rosée was in 1658, after which Bowman ran the coffee-house with his wife until his death in 1662. There are stories that Rosée left London as a result of a misdemeanour and that he went to Holland or Germany to sell coffee, although there is no evidence this was the case.
    
    The number of coffee-houses grew rapidly after Rosée opened his outlet. By 1708 there were 500–600 in London and Westminster, and others in provincial cities. The original premises of the coffee-house was destroyed in the 1666 Great Fire of London. On its location is a late nineteenth century building housing—in the twenty-first century—a pub, the Jamaica Wine House; a commemorative plaque is now on the spot, unveiled in 1952—the tercentenary of the founding of Rosée's shop.`,

    content: `Pasqua Rosée (fl. 1651–1658) was a 17th-century servant who opened the first coffee-house in London and possibly Britain. He was born into the ethnic Greek community of the Republic of Ragusa (now southernmost Croatia). In 1651 he became the servant of Daniel Edwards, an English merchant of the Levant Company who was living in Smyrna (modern İzmir, Turkey) in the Ottoman Empire; Rosée's duties included preparing and serving Edwards's daily coffee.

    In late 1651 Edwards returned to London, taking Rosée with him. The number and frequency of friends visiting Edwards to drink coffee with him disrupted his social life, and so he set up Rosée as the proprietor of a coffee-house near the Royal Exchange. As he was not a freeman of the City of London he was not able to trade; accordingly Edwards made his father-in-law's former apprentice, Christopher "Kitt" Bowman—a freeman of the City—join Rosée as a partner. The last known reference to Rosée was in 1658, after which Bowman ran the coffee-house with his wife until his death in 1662. There are stories that Rosée left London as a result of a misdemeanour and that he went to Holland or Germany to sell coffee, although there is no evidence this was the case.
    
    The number of coffee-houses grew rapidly after Rosée opened his outlet. By 1708 there were 500–600 in London and Westminster, and others in provincial cities. The original premises of the coffee-house was destroyed in the 1666 Great Fire of London. On its location is a late nineteenth century building housing—in the twenty-first century—a pub, the Jamaica Wine House; a commemorative plaque is now on the spot, unveiled in 1952—the tercentenary of the founding of Rosée's shop.`,

    content: `Edwards and Rosée selected premises in St Michael's Alley, just off Cornhill and near the Royal Exchange. The lanes and alleys around the Exchange—a favoured place for merchants to meet daily—were busy with traders, lawyers, tavern keepers and the general public. The first incarnation of their coffee-house was a shed resembling a market stall on the edge of the churchyard of St Michael's Church.[18] A sign hung over Rosée's stall, described either as "an image of himself dressed in some Levantine clothing",[19] or a sign portraying his head.[20]

    To promote his enterprise, in 1652 Rosée published a handbill advertising The Vertue of the Coffee Drink in which he extolled the benefits of coffee,[1] claiming "It is excellent to prevent and cure the dropsy, gout and scurvy",[21] as well as scrofula, miscarriages and "a most excellent remedy against the spleen, hypocondriack winds and the like".[21] This was the earliest-known advertisement for coffee, according to the historian Aytoun Ellis.[22] The launch of the new product onto the London market was aided by the politics of the day, with puritans attacking the sale of wine and beer as being connected to the profligate and licentious activities of the Royalists. Taverners and wine merchants bemoaned the falling sales of their products in 1651 and 1652, and Rosée's positioning of coffee as a healthy and sober drink helped the product become commercially successful. One contemporary estimated that Rosée's turnover was 30 or 40 shillings a day – approximately £450 to 600 a year.[23][c]
    
    Markman Ellis considers the estimate is "probably overstated", although Rosée's business was successful enough to generate jealousy from local tavern owners; they petitioned the Lord Mayor of London on the basis that Rosée was not a freeman of the City of London, and therefore should not be able to trade as he did.[25] To overcome the barrier to Rosée's continuing trading, Edwards turned to his father-in-law, Alderman Thomas Hodges, who proposed one of his former apprentices, Christopher "Kitt" Bowman, a freeman of the City of London, to join Rosée as a partner, which took place in 1654.[1][26]

    In 1656 Rosée and Bowman moved from their shed into premises, also in St Michael's Alley, which measured 27.5 by 19 feet (8.4 by 5.8 m); the property was in poor condition, needing repairs and the men paid an annual rent of £4.[1][d] The two men operated in partnership until at least 1658 (when they were both listed in the churchwardens' accounts), but Rosée seems to have no part in the joint venture after that.[27] The two men also ran competing coffee-houses on opposite sides of the street,[1] which was remembered in doggerel verse, published under the name Adrianus del Tasso:[28]
    
    Pull courage, Pasqua, fear no Harms,
    From the besieging Foe;
    Make good your ground, stand to your Arms,
    Hold out this summer, and then tho'
    He'll storm, he'll not prevail—your Face
    Shall give the Coffee Pot the chace.[29]
    
    There are no records relating to Rosée after 1658.[27] The apothecary and writer John Houghton, writing in 1699, said that Rosée disappeared from London "for some misdemeanour",[30] although no record or evidence for the misdemeanour has been found.[31] There were claims that he left England and sold coffee in Germany or Holland—the latter in 1664—but there is no evidence to support either claim.[31][32]`,
